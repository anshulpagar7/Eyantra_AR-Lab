# Eyantra_AR-Lab
Eyantra is an AR-based virtual circuit lab that visualizes and simulates electronics experiments using a webcam and a single QR/ArUco marker. It builds circuits step-by-step, displays real-time voltages and currents, and helps students learn how circuits work without needing physical components.
